## A single-header C++ library for making simple 2D games 
* **PLATFORM**: Windows
* **LANGUAGE**: C++
* **ENVIRONMENT**: Visual Studio

## Why?
Learning C++ is often seen as dry and difficult, partly because the examples used in teaching are usually text-based and uninspiring. PlayBuffer was designed to try and limit the cognitive demands of learning C++ while increasing the "payoff" for the learner by allowing them to make simple, 2D games while they are doing it!

## A Learning Scaffold
The PlayBuffer is not a "serious" game-development framework, and is intended to be used as a temporary "scaffold" to be discarded once the learner has outgrown it. The library code is simple enough that that a learner could reasonably expect to understand how most of it works for themselves before moving on to a more sophisticated framework. It uses the simplest native Windows libraries (no DirectX/OpenGl/Vulcan) and implements sprite rendering in software, making it an interesting platform for studying basic C++ code optimisation.

## Getting Started

### What will you need?
- A Windows-based PC (age and performance isn't too critical)
- A free copy of the "Community Edition" of Visual Studio

### Hello World to Spy Wire
It's traditional for programming tutorials to begin by displaying "Hello World!" to the screen. This project is a useful starting point for any PlayBuffer application, but also includes a pdf manual which will take you from Hello World to your first complete shoot-'em-up game!

### First steps
- For a simple introduction to C++ (with a bit of maths thrown in) download this and follow this video.
- Otherwise simply download the "Hello World" project and follow the pdf tutorial in the accompanying manual.
